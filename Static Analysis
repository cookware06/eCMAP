Static Analysis Techniques

Here we are going to understand the below points,

1. How to identify samples, generate hashes and extract strings that may aid during the analysis.
2. When and why to use an online scanner or sandbox
3. PE File format and how it's used in malware analysis
4. Obfuscation and basic detection methods
5. How to collect IOC's from samples and write YARA signatures to search for malware on systems.

Basic analysis refers to observing the file's metadata and the other information that's embedded in it.

In Advanced analysis, analyst examines the source code of the malware (Analysis on the disassembled to assembled code).

Basic Static Analysis

1. File Identification and Classification
2. Scanning
3. File Format Analysis
4. Identifying Obfuscation


File Identification and Classification

It is process of identifying the file type and obtaining a unique "signature" of the sample being analyzed.

E.g An SSN number

Based on File Types:

1. PE
2. PDF
3. DOCX

Base on File Hashes

1. MD5
2. SHA1
3. Fuzzy Hash

Based on the Strings: 

ASCII or Unicode

ASCII (Plain text) files, -  no further explanation required as it just plain text files 
Structured (Binary) Files - Files which has binary structure, E.g PDF and EXE has different structure.

If you take a hexadecimal look at PDF or a PNG file, you will see file starts with %PDF or %PNG with different header and trailer
